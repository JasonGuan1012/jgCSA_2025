    "### Unit 1: Primitive Types\n",
    "- Introduces basic data types like `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`.\n",
    "- Focuses on variable declaration, initialization, and use in expressions.\n",
    "- Arithmetic operations, including division, modulus, and type casting.\n",
    "- Explores data conversions between primitive types (e.g., `int` to `double`).\n",
    "- Discusses the importance of precision in data types like `float` and `double`.\n",
    "- Logical and comparison operators for basic decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connections to PBL:**\n",
    "- In a PBL project, primitive types are used to validate and process user input on the **front-end** (e.g., form data like age, price).\n",
    "- In the **back-end**, primitive types are often involved in database queries and logic (e.g., comparing IDs or calculating totals).\n",
    "- **API interactions** require these types to parse and validate incoming data (e.g., a request that contains product prices or user ages).\n",
