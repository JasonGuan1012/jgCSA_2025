    "### Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements\n",
    "- Introduces Boolean data type (`true`/`false`) and logical expressions.\n",
    "- Focuses on decision-making structures using `if`, `else if`, and `else`.\n",
    "- Covers relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`) for comparisons.\n",
    "- Uses logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) to build more complex conditions.\n",
    "- Explores nested `if` statements and the role of indentation for readability.\n",
    "- Introduces short-circuiting and why it matters in logical operations.\n",

    "**Connections to PBL:**\n",
    "- In a **front-end** project, Boolean expressions are used for conditional rendering (e.g., showing a loading spinner or error message).\n",
    "- **API logic** relies on Boolean expressions to validate requests (e.g., checking if a user is authorized before providing access).\n",
    "- On the **back-end**, Boolean logic is often used to control flow, such as allowing or denying access based on user roles.\n",
