    "### Unit 8: 2D Arrays\n",
    "- Introduces two-dimensional arrays for storing data in a grid-like structure.\n",
    "- Discusses accessing elements using two indices (rows and columns).\n",
    "- Covers common use cases, like representing matrices or tables of data.\n",
    "- Introduces nested loops to traverse 2D arrays.\n",
    "- Discusses common operations, like summing rows/columns or searching for specific elements.\n",
    "- Explores memory representation and how 2D arrays are stored internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connections to PBL:**\n",
    "- In **front-end** applications, 2D arrays can be used to render data in table format (e.g., displaying rows of product data).\n",
    "- On the **back-end**, 2D arrays can represent more complex datasets or grids (e.g., seating charts or adjacency matrices).\n",
    "- **APIs** that deal with structured data (like spreadsheets) might send or receive data in a 2D array format.\n",
