    "### Unit 6: Arrays\n",
    "- Introduces one-dimensional arrays to store multiple values of the same type.\n",
    "- Covers array declaration, initialization, and accessing elements by index.\n",
    "- Discusses array bounds, common errors (like `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`).\n",
    "- Shows how to iterate through arrays using loops.\n",
    "- Covers searching and sorting arrays (e.g., linear search, selection sort).\n",
    "- Explores common array algorithms like summing or finding the maximum value.\n",

    "**Connections to PBL:**\n",
    "- Arrays are used on the **back-end** for managing collections of data (e.g., storing a list of users or products in memory).\n",
    "- In **front-end** projects, arrays hold data to render multiple UI elements, like lists of items.\n",
    "- Arrays are often passed back and forth between **front-end** and **API** for batch processing or handling multiple inputs (e.g., submitting a form with multiple entries).\n",
