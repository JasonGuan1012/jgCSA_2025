    "### Unit 9: Inheritance\n",
    "- Introduces inheritance as a way to create a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "- Discusses extending a class using `extends` to reuse code and functionality.\n",
    "- Covers the `super` keyword for accessing parent class constructors or methods.\n",
    "- Explores overriding methods in subclasses to provide specialized behavior.\n",
    "- Introduces polymorphism and how subclasses can be treated as their parent class.\n",
    "- Discusses abstract classes and interfaces to define common behaviors.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Connections to PBL:**\n",
    "- In **back-end** systems, inheritance allows developers to extend base models (e.g., creating a subclass `Admin` from a `User` class).\n",
    "- **Front-end** frameworks leverage inheritance to extend UI components and maintain consistency across applications.\n",
    "- **API design** might include creating different types of requests or responses that inherit common functionality (e.g., different user roles or product types).\n",
