    "### Unit 4: Iteration\n",
    "- Explains loops (`for`, `while`, and `do-while`) and their structures.\n",
    "- Discusses controlling loops with counters, conditions, and `break`/`continue` statements.\n",
    "- Explores nested loops and their role in processing multi-dimensional data.\n",
    "- Introduces the concept of traversing arrays or lists with loops.\n",
    "- Discusses infinite loops and how to avoid them.\n",
    "- Explores practical applications of loops, like summing numbers or searching data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connections to PBL:**\n",
    "- In the **front-end**, loops are essential for rendering lists of data dynamically, like displaying products in an e-commerce app.\n",
    "- **APIs** often iterate through data (e.g., looping through user records in a database) to process requests or respond with multiple items.\n",
    "- On the **back-end**, iteration is vital for performing batch operations or looping through datasets retrieved from a database.\n",
