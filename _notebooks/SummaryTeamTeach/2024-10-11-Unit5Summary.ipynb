    "### Unit 5: Writing Classes\n",
    "- Introduces class creation, with attributes (fields) and methods (behaviors).\n",
    "- Discusses access modifiers (`private`, `public`) to encapsulate data.\n",
    "- Explores constructors for object instantiation and method overloading.\n",
    "- Demonstrates how to define and use methods, including returning values.\n",
    "- Introduces the concept of `this` to reference the current instance.\n",
    "- Covers encapsulation to protect class attributes and allow controlled access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connections to PBL:**\n",
    "- In the **back-end**, classes are used to define the structure of data entities like `User`, `Order`, or `Product`, with methods to handle their behaviors (e.g., processing orders).\n",
    "- **Front-end** libraries and frameworks use classes to manage UI components (e.g., React class components).\n",
    "- **API** design often involves defining classes for data models that are serialized and deserialized when sending or receiving data.\n",
