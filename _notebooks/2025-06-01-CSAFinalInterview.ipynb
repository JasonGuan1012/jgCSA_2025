    "## **UNIQUE** Qualities\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adapted quickly to different challenges within the **Gamify** team of **Fortune Finders**, focusing on the **Crypto Mining Simulator** and contributing ideas that made the gameplay more engaging and realistic.\n",
    "- Took initiative during group discussions, helping plan out features like the energy system, leaderboard, and GPU management to make the game both fun and educational.\n",
    "- Gained experience with both frontend logic (JavaScript modules, real-time charts, UI modals) and backend integration (Spring Boot APIs for mining and inventory).\n",
    "- Worked actively with teammates to debug complex issues, especially with mining logic, GPU data updates, and UI responsiveness.\n",
    "- Helped explain the simulator to users during testing and Night at the Museum, improving my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly to non-developers.\n"

    "N@TM was such an awesome event! I had a great time showing my project to parents, students, and other guests, and it felt good to share what I‚Äôve been working on this year. It was also really cool to see what other CSSE and CSP students made, and some of their ideas were super creative and impressive. I liked getting to talk with people, share ideas, and learn from others. Overall, the night was a great experience, and it made me more excited to keep learning and building in the future.\n"
