    "1. Learn Units #1-#10 from the College Board.\n",
    "2. Build a lesson using Java for each of the topics provided by the teacher's starters.\n",
    "3. The lesson should include a Tech Talk portion, popcorn hacks, and homework hacks. The lesson should NOT have more than 5 minutes of talking before engaging students in an activity (e.g., popcorn hacks).\n",
    "4. Be prepared to grade homework. This means having a plan for homework and a plan for grading the homework. You will grade on a \"1-point\" scale. Weight popcorn hacks and homework hacks in the grading.\n",
    "5. Lesson time will be between 20 and 30 minutes. Homework time should be about the same as lesson time."

He provided examples and pictures which were very helpful in understanding the sorting concepts. One thing to improve on is making the page a little more interactive. I also really liked the lesson home page which involved the ArrayList bubbles. It was super cool! |"
