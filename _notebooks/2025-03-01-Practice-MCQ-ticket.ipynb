    "\n",
    "**Q33: Find maximum in 1D int array**\n",
    "- The correct answer should be **Answer E** because Choice I sets max to Integer.MIN_VALUE, which is the smallest possible integer value. Then it accesses each element in arr and assigns them value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q35: Iterative binarySearch of 1D int array**\n",
    "- The correct answer should **Answer C** because in the first iteration of the binary search, it will check the value at index (0 + 7) / 2 which is index 3. Since 8 is greater than data[3], start is assigned mid + 1 which is 4 and the process will repeat. In the second iteration of the while loop, it will check the value at index (4 + 7) / 2 which is index 5. Since data[5] is 8, 5 is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q37: concatWords method with String array**\n",
    "- The correct answer is **Answer E** because Choice I adds duplicates, Choice II reverses order, and Choice III correctly reverses and selects elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q38: mystery method with 1D int array, v and numVals**\n",
    "- The correct answer is **Answer C** because the method recursively counts occurrences of `v` in `numbers`, summing 1 for matches and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q39: Consider the following code segment.**\n",
    "- The correct answer is **Answer C** because the first loop replaces all elements with \"Alex\" while printing original values, and the second loop prints \"Alex\" for each element."
